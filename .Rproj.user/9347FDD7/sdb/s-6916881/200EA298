    "contents" : "###### ISSR Intro To R Workshop, 2/20/15, contact mdenny@polsci.umass.edu #####\n\n\n###### Preliminaries -- Setting Up R To Do Work ######\n\n# Clear your workspace -- This gets rid of all of the information that was there when you started to you have a clean slate.\nrm(list = ls())\n\n# Set your working directory -- This is where R goes to look for files and save stuff by default. You will need to do this for each computer you run your script file on. In RStudio, you can go to Session -> Set Working Directory -> Choose Directory and select a folder from a drop down menu. For me, this looks like:\n#setwd(\"~/Dropbox/RA_and_Consulting_Work/ISSR_Consulting_Work/Intermediate_R\")\ngetwd()\n\n###### cat vs. print ######\n\n# the cat function will print things without \"\" marks around them, which often looks nicer, but it also does not skip to a new line if you call it multiple times inside of a function (something we will get to soon) or a loop. Lets try out both:\nprint(\"Hello World\")\ncat(\"Hello World\")\n\n#now we can try them inside brackets to see how cat does not break lines:\n{\n    cat(\"Hello\")\n    cat(\"World\")\n}\n\n{\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"World\")\n}\n\n###### The paste function and making informative messages ######\n\n#the paste function takes as many string, number or variable arguments as you want and sticks them all together using a user specified separator:\n\n# lets define a variable to hold the number of fingers we have:\nfingers <- 10\n#now lets print out how many fingers we have:\nprint(paste(\"Hello,\", \"I have\", fingers, \"Fingers\", sep = \" \"))\n#now lets separate with dashes just for fun:\nprint(paste(\"Hello,\", \"I have\", fingers, \"Fingers\", sep = \"---\"))\n\n#now lets try the same thing with cat\ncat(paste(\"Hello,\", \"I have\", fingers, \"Fingers\", sep = \" \"))\n#however, with cat, I can just skip the paste part and it will print the stuff directly\ncat(\"Hello,\", \"I have\", fingers, \"Fingers\")\n\n#if we want cat to break lines while it is printing, we can also include the \"\\n\" symbol at the end (or anywhere for that matter)\ncat(\"My Grocery List:\\n\", \"1 dozen eggs\\n\",\"1 loaf of bread\\n 1 bottle of orange juice\\n\", \"1 pint mass mocha\")\n\n###### For Loops ######\n\n#this is a way to automate performing tasks my telling R how many times you want to do something. Along with conditional statments and comparison operators, loops are more powerful than you can immagine. Pretty much everything on your computer can be boiled down to a combinations of these.\n\n# for (           i in           1:10){\n# for each number i in the range 1:10\n\n# example of a for() loop -- first lets make a vector of data\nmy_vector <- c(20:30)\nmy_vector2 = 20:30\ncheck= my_vector==my_vector2\ncat(\"Am I right?\", check)\nprint(check)\n# take a look\ncat(my_vector)\n\nfor(i in 1:length(my_vector)){\n    my_vector[i] <- sqrt(my_vector[i])\n}\n#display the result\ncat(my_vector)\n\nmyNum = 0\nfor(i in 1:15){\n  myNum = myNum + 3\n  cat(\"Current iteration is\", i, \"\\n\", \"Current value is\", myNum,\"\\n\")\n}\n\n\n###### If/Else Statements ######\n\n# these give your computer a \"brain\", they let it see if somethng is the case, and dependent on that answer your compute can then take some desired action.\n\n#if(some condition is met){\n#     do something\n#}\n\n#lets try an example to check and see if our number is equal to 20\nmy_number <- 19\nif(my_number < 20){\n    cat(\"My number is less than 20\")\n}\nmy_number <- 22\nif(my_number < 20){\n    cat(\"My number is less than 20\")\n}\n\n\n# example of an if statement\nmy_vector <- c(20:30)\nfor(i in 1:length(my_vector)){\n    cat(\"Current Index:\",i,\"Value:\",my_vector[i],\"\\n\")\n    if(my_vector[i] == 25){\n        cat(\"The square root is 5! \\n\")\n    }\n}\n\n\n# you can also add in an else statement to do something else if the condition is not met.\nmy_vector <- c(20:30)\nfor(i in 1:length(my_vector)){\n    cat(\"Current Index:\",i,\"Value:\",my_vector[i],\"\\n\")\n    if(my_vector[i] == 25){\n        print(\"I am 25!\")\n    }else{\n        print(\"I am not 25!\")\n    }\n}\n\nmy_vector <- c(20:30)\nfor(i in 1:length(my_vector)){\n  cat(\"Current Index:\",i,\"Value:\",my_vector[i],\"\\n\")\n  if(my_vector[i] == 25){\n    print(\"I am 25!\")\n  }else{\n    print(\"I am not 25!\")\n  }\n}\n\n###### Functions ######\n\n#user defined functions allow you to easily reuse a section of code\n\n#define a function that will take the sum of a particular column of a matrix (where the column index is a number)\nmy_column_sum <- function(col_number,my_matrix ){ \n    #take the column sum of the matrix\n    col_sum <- sum(my_matrix[,col_number])\n    return(col_sum)\n}\n\n#lets try it out\nmy_mat <- matrix(1:100,nrow=10,ncol=10)\n#look at out matrix\nmy_mat\n#take its column sum\nmy_column_sum(1,my_mat)\n\n\n# a more complicated example -- write a function to go get the number of results that pop up for a given name in google scholar.

Among many variables, it contains indicators of the number of cosponsors, the month the bill was introduced, the chamber it was introduced in (House or Senate), the major topic code (see reference list below) and the party of the sponsor. \n\n# Lets say we wanted to look at a subset of all bills that were introduced in the House that were about any of the first ten topics and then take a the sum of the number of bills introduced in each month by each party that passed the house and divide by the total number of cosponsorships they recieved to get a weight for the effectiveness of each cosponsorship.
